Descend.js gives you a simple `descend` function you can attach to constructors
or call directly to give you an inherited class (constructor with inherited
`prototype`) that calls its ancestor constructors automatically when
instantiated.

It also instantiates if any of the descendant constructors are called without
using the `new` keyword.

Descend.js also sets the `constructor` property correctly on descendants. It
does not set any other property thereby keeping your objects clean.


Installing
----------
### Installing on Node.js
```
npm install descend
```


Using
-----
### Using on constructors
Attach `descend` (or name it `inherit` or whatever you like) on a constructor:
```javascript
function Model() { console.log("Model initialized.") }
Model.descend = require("descend")

var Child = Model.descend(function() { console.log("Child initialized.") })
new Child // Will output both "Model initialized." and "Child initialized."
```

If you want descendant classes to also have the `descend` function, you might
want to add it to them afterwards:
```javascript
var descend = require("descend")
function Model() {}

Model.descend = function() {
  var descendant = descend.apply(this, arguments)
  descendant.descend = this.descend
  return descendant
}
```


### Using as a function
Call `descend` with the constructor and the descendant's initializer:
```javascript
var descend = require("descend")
function Model() { console.log("Model initialized.") }
var Child = descend(Model, function() { console.log("Child initialized.") })
new Child // Will output both "Model initialized." and "Child initialized."
```
